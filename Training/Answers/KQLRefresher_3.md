> Run a query by clicking the Run button or pressing Shift+Enter. Consider the following details which determine the code that will be run and the data that's returned:
> - Line breaks: A single break makes your query clearer. Multiple line breaks split it into separate queries.
> - Cursor: Place your cursor somewhere inside the query to execute it. The current query is considered to be the code up until a blank line is found.
> - Time range - A time range of last 24 hours is set by default. To use a different range, use the time-picker or add an explicit time range filter to your query.
